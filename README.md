## Servers Configuration
Servers should be setup similar to the examples already in `server.json`:
* There are two supported types: `http` and `ping`
```json
[
    {
      "name": "Google",
      "type": "http",
      "address": "google.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Cloudflare",
      "type": "ping",
      "address": "1.1.1.1"
    }
]
```

## Commands
> Default Prefix: >

* `http <address>` - Performs a HTTP request to the specified address and returns the response code
* `status` - Displays the status of all servers setup in `servers.json`
